## Logistic regression

## Naive bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier assumes that all the features are unrelated to each other. Presence or absence of a feature does not influence the presence or absence of any other feature.


* Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes consider a feature vector where a given term represents the number of times it appears or very often i.e. frequency. 

* In the multivariate Bernoulli event model,  a binary algorithm used when the feature is present or not. 


* When we have continuous attribute values, we made an assumption that the values associated with each class are distributed according to Gaussian or Normal distribution.
